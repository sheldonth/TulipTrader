// TabStripModel. The Obj-C part of this class handles drag and drop and all
// the other Cocoa-y aspects.

// you have retained them.

// where the user dropped the new tab so it can be animated into its correct
// location when the tab is added to the model. If the tab was pinned in its
// previous window, setting |pinned| to YES will propagate that state to the
// new window. Mini-tabs are either app or pinned tabs; the app state is stored
// by the |contents|, but the |pinned| state is the caller's responsibility.
