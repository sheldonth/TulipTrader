@class CTBrowserWindowController;
@class DropdownAnimation;

// Provides a controller to manage presentation mode for a single browser
// window.  This class handles running animations, showing and hiding the
// floating dropdown bar, and managing the tracking area associated with the
// dropdown.  This class does not directly manage any views -- the
// BrowserWindowController is responsible for positioning and z-ordering views.
//
// Tracking areas are disabled while animations are running.  If
// |overlayFrameChanged:| is called while an animation is running, the
// controller saves the new frame and installs the appropriate tracking area
// when the animation finishes.  This is largely done for ease of
// implementation; it is easier to check the mouse location at each animation
// step than it is to manage a constantly-changing tracking area.

// Designated initializer.
- (id)initWithBrowserController:(CTBrowserWindowController*)controller;

// Informs the controller that the browser has entered or exited presentation
// mode. |-enterPresentationModeForContentView:showDropdown:| should be called
// after the window is setup, just before it is shown. |-exitPresentationMode|
// should be called before any views are moved back to the non-fullscreen
// window.  If |-enterPresentationModeForContentView:showDropdown:| is called,
// it must be balanced with a call to |-exitPresentationMode| before the
// controller is released.

// otherwise.
